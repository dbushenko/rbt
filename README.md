# rbt

Utility which compiles separate Markdown files with requirements into one software requirements document.

Features:

1. Checks definied IDs uniqueness.
2. Checks that referenced ID exists.
3. Allows referencing to the requirement's header by its ID.

## Usage

You need a 'reqs.edn' file inside your project directory. Example:

	{:src "mdsrc"
	 :document "doc.md"
	 :files ["ucs.md", "ui.md"]
	}

* :src -- the source directory where the Markdown files are placed.
* :document -- the resulting file name containing compiled Markdown files.
* :files -- list of Markdown files to be compiled. The order of the files will be preserved.

Run the 'rbt' tool as a normal jar inside the project directory where your 'reqs.edn' file exists.

	$ java -jar rbt-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-standalone.jar 

### Supported types of defined IDs

1. Header IDs in square brackets:

        ## [MY-ID] My requirement header

In this case the ID of the requirement will by 'MY-ID'.

2. Complex format:

	    #id:{01|Button title}

This is a local ID definition to be used in lists or tables. If defined within the requiement with ID like previous one, the resulting ID will be 'MY-ID/01'.


### Supported types of references

1. #refId:ID -- refrence text will be its ID.

Example: #refId:MY-ID will be transformed to [MY-ID](#MY-ID).

2. #refText:ID -- refrence text will be its text.

Example: #refText:MY-ID will be transformed to [My requirement header](#MY-ID).

3. #ref:ID -- reference text will be the combination of its ID and text: '[ID] Text'.

Example: #ref:MY-ID will be transformed to [MY-ID: My requirement header](#MY-ID).

4. #refsTo:ID -- lists all references to this requirement.

5. #refsFrom:ID -- lists all references from this requirement.
